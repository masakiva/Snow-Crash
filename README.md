# Snow-Crash

Snow-Crash is a security project from the 42 school, designed to teach students about common security flaws and how to exploit them. The project consists of a series of challenges that simulate real-world security issues.

The challenges cover a range of topics including buffer overflow attacks, reverse engineering, format string vulnerabilities, race conditions, and more. Each challenge provides a description of the security issue and some initial information, and the student must use their knowledge and skills to find a solution.

### Usage

Snow-Crash is designed to be run on a Linux machine.

Each level is a standalone program that needs to be exploited to retrieve the password for the next level. The password can be obtained by exploiting a vulnerability in the program and sending the correct input.
